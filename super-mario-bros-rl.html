<h1>Super Mario Bros Reinforcement Learning</h1>

<p class="centered-text">Watch the computer learn how to play one of the most iconic video games of all time!</p>
<div class="text-container">
    <p>All footage below is the computer playing the game with no human intervention. An "iteration"
    is one playthrough of the game, regardless of whether the computer beats the level or dies. As each iteration
    progresses, the computer slowly learns which buttons to press based on what's on the screen.</p>
</div>
<p class="centered-text">The code for this project was inspired by the following paper:</p>
<button><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf">Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning</a></button>
<p class="centered-text">To learn about how the computer is learning from each iteration, check out my blog post
    about Reinforcement Learning:</p>

<h2>Zero iterations</h2>

    <p>At the very beginning, with no experience, the computer clearly doesn't know much about the game. It only
        knows to go right without jumping; It doesn't even know that a goomba is deadly.</p>

<h2>1000 iterations</h2>

    <p>After 1,000 iterations, the computer knows how to jump and avoid the goombas, but unfortunately it falls into
        the hole.</p>

<h2>5000 iterations</h2>

    <p>After 5,000 iterations, the computer knows how to maneuver with more confidence, but it still makes some
        mistakes, leading to its demise.</p>

<div class="text-container">
    <p>After 10,000 iterations, we see the computer finally complete the level! It knows which objects on the screen
    are obstacles and what to do when approaching one.</p>
