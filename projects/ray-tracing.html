    <h1>Ray Tracer from Scratch</h1>

    <h2 class="centered-text">The defining technique for the current generation of computer graphics</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>Ray tracing is a computer graphics technique which simulates light's behavior in the real world. This leads
            to much more realistic shading, shadows, and reflections in a scene. A brute force approach way is sending
            millions of light rays from all of the light sources in the scene and having them react to the objects and
            materials appropriately. If the light ray hits a diffuse material, it should be scattered randomly. If it
            hits a glass object, it should either reflect or refract as light does with regards to glass in the real
            world. We then would keep track of all of the rays that enter the camera and use them to draw a picture of
            the scene.</p>
        <p>Because a lot of light rays shot into the scene will never make it into the camera, a lot of the computations are wasted. One optimization that all ray tracers make is to shoot the rays from the camera, rather than the light sources. This essentially tracing the path of the light backwards, which guarantees that the ray calculations will contribute to the final render.</p>
        <p>I have coded a simple ray tracer below, along with some renders I've created from it. For each render, you'll see the complementary scene made in Blender. While the results aren't exact, it's very rewarding to see how closely the shadows, reflections, and caustics resemble a more professional solution.</p>
        <p>The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Sourish07/RayTracer-From-Scratch">here</a>. Feel free to check it out and either try it or give me any feedback. As a side note, a lot of my code and knowledge base about ray tracing is heavily derived from Peter Shirley's <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">book series</a>, so special thanks to him for writing it.</p>
