    <h1>Ray Tracer from Scratch</h1>

    <h2 class="centered-text">The defining technique for the current generation of computer graphics</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>Ray tracing is a computer graphics technique which simulates light's behavior in the real world. This leads
            to much more realistic shading, shadows, and reflections in a scene, which is extremely valuable for
            modern-day computer graphics in video games and movies. A brute force approach is sending millions of
            light rays from all of the light sources in the scene and having them react to the objects and materials
            appropriately. If the light ray hits a diffuse material, it should be scattered randomly. If it hits a glass
            object, it should either reflect or refract as light does with regards to glass in the real world. We then
            would keep track of all of the rays that enter the camera and use them to draw a picture of the scene.</p>
        <p>Because a lot of light rays shot into the scene will never make it into the camera, a lot of the computations
            are wasted. One optimization that all ray tracers make is to shoot the rays from the camera, rather than the
            light sources. This essentially is tracing the path of the light backwards, which guarantees that all ray
            calculations will contribute to the final render.</p>
        <p>I have coded a simple ray tracer which has global illumination, anti-aliasing, caustics, and subsurface
            scattering. For each
            render shown below, you'll see the complementary scene made in Blender. While the results aren't exact, it's
            very rewarding to see how closely the shadows, reflections, and shading resemble a more professional
            solution.</p>
        <p>The code for this project can be found <a
                href="https://github.com/Sourish07/RayTracer-From-Scratch">here</a>. Feel free to check it out and
            either try it or give me any feedback. As a side note, a lot of my code and knowledge base about ray tracing
            is heavily derived and adapted from Peter Shirley's <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">book series</a>,
            so special
            thanks to him for writing it.</p>
        <p>Python isn't the most ideal language for writing a ray tracer, but by using pypy, the render times are much
            more reasonable. For the future, I plan on implementing many more features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real time rendering on the GPU with C++ and OpenGL</li>
            <li>Moveable camera for animations</li>
            <li>Textures</li>
            <li>Skybox</li>
            <li>More shapes like hearts and toruses</li>
            <li>Support for mesh models</li>
            <li>Importance sampling</li>
            <li>Bidirectional path tracing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stay tuned for these features to be released!</p>
