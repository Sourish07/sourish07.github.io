        <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning algorithms that involve an agent and an
            environment. The goal is to train the agent to take actions in its environment that maximize its return.
            Some common applications of RL are training the computer to play video games, trade stocks, or drive a car.
            The basic premise of training a computer to perform these human-like tasks is very similar to using positive
            reinforcement from psychology.</p>
        <p>Think about training a dog to perform a trick. The end goal is for the furry canine to complete the entirety
            of the trick. If the trick is an obstacle course, the trainer would want to give the dog a treat every time
            it completes part of the course, relaying to the dog it is on the right track and it should go further next
            time for more treats. If the dog fails the obstacle in front of it, the trainer will not give the dog a
            treat. Eventually, the dog learns which actions earn it a treat and which ones do not, leading to the dog
            completing the course. The computer works in a very similar fashion.</p>
        <p>Let us say we want to train the computer to drive a virtual car through a racetrack. The agent is the car,
            and the environment is the course. The end goal for the agent is to cross the finish line. Initially, the
            computer has no idea how to drive a car or what even the end goal is; thus it will start off by pressing
            random buttons. So, we may want to provide the computer with a reward every time it goes forward. This
            teaches the computer that going forward will increase its reward more than going backwards. We may also want
            to give the computer a negative reward if it turns around or if it goes off the track. This teaches the
            computer to avoid taking such actions. We also may give it a negative reward each second it doesn't finish,
            enforcing the idea that speed is also a factor that needs to be considered. Finally, we may give it a very
            large reward if it does end up crossing the finish line, which finishes the iteration. Additionally, if
            there are obstacles on the racecourse, we can give the computer a large negative reward if it collides with
            any of them, leading to an early termination of the iteration. As each training iteration progresses, the
            computer will slowly become more confident in what actions to take to maximize its rewards; It'll start
            taking less random actions and more of the actions it deems as fruitful. After thousands of training
            iterations, the computer will have learned how to navigate the car through the racetrack by taking the
            actions that'll grant it positive rewards and avoiding the ones that'll grant it negative rewards.</p>
        <p>The implications of RL are thunderous in the real world. In 2016, the first computer Go program by the
            world's best human players. It can revolutionize travel by making driverless cars safe and widely accessible
            and trustworthy. It can change the way recommendation systems work, leading to more personalized content
            just a tap away. RL can be scary at first, but if we can harness its positive potential and be cognizant of
            the risks, it will change the world for the better.</p>
