    <h1>Super Mario Bros Reinforcement Learning</h1>

    <h2>Watch the computer learn how to play one of the most iconic video games of all time!</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>We use Reinforcement Learning, a subfield of Machine Learning, to teach the computer how to play the game. In
            RL, we reinforce behaviors we want the computer, i.e. our agent, to exhibit. Think about training a dog to
            perform a
            trick. The goal is for the furry canine to complete the entirety of
            the trick. If the trick is an obstacle course, the trainer would want to give the dog a treat every time it
            completes part of the course, relaying to the dog it is on the right track and it should go further next
            time for
            more treats. If the dog fails the obstacle in front of it, the trainer will not give the dog a treat.
            Eventually,
            the dog learns which actions earn it a treat and which ones do not, leading to the dog completing the
            course. The
            computer works in a very similar fashion.</p>
        <p>In this scenario, the computer is given a positive reward for moving right, a negative reward for standing
            still,
            and an even more negative reward for dying. Using neural networks, it starts to learn which actions to take
            in order to maximize its rewards, just like our dog!</p>
        <p>All footage below is the computer playing the game with no human intervention. An "iteration"
            is one playthrough of the game, regardless of whether the computer beats the level or dies. This agent is
            using
            the Double Deep Q Learning algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Zero iterations</h3>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>At the very beginning, with no experience, the computer clearly doesn't know much about the game. It only
            knows to go right without jumping; It doesn't even know that a goomba is deadly.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>1000 iterations</h3>
    <video playsinline autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="../../resources/images/supermariobrosrl/1000-iterations.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </video>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>After 1,000 iterations, the computer knows how to jump and avoid the goombas, but unfortunately it falls into
            the hole.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>5000 iterations</h3>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>After 5,000 iterations, the computer knows how to maneuver with more confidence, but it still makes some
            mistakes, leading to its demise.</p>

    <h3>10000 iterations</h3>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>After 10,000 iterations, we see the computer finally completes the level! It knows which objects on the
            screen
            are obstacles and what to do when approaching one.</p>
