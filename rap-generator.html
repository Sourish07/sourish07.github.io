                I tweaked and retrained Open AI's GPT-2 on the lyrics of some of my favorite rap artists. I then
                generated lyrics with the trained models and chose some of the best output to share. I aggregated the
                lyrics for each artist using Selenium and Genius.com.<br><br>
                My first idea was to use RNNs and LSTMs and create and train the model from scratch. This was simply
                not
                possible as the corpus for each artist was only tens of thousands of lines. In comparison, GPT-2 was
                trained on millions of text samples. Simply put, no model I created on my own would be at the same
                caliber as a pretrained language model. Thus, I was forced to trash all the work I had done with
                RNNs and LSTMs.

                                Loved fruits and veggies<br>

                                I can make it in this bitch<br>
                                Ain't no roses up for sale<br>
                                All that good shit that I just experienced<br>
                                Bitches tried to tell me I can't do it, nah<br>
                                I'd rather be the father of a n**** that's gon' be the first n**** out the parkin'<br>
                                Fuck this rat-race shit, I'm on that shit like Henny<br>
                                She said, "N****, you know you can do it<br>
                                Any more pussy your man won't get in the bonnet<br>
                                That's one thing a n**** don't get taught in this game<br>
                                Is to jack your girl and ride to fame like Stan."<br>
                                And so I was on that dick for like<br>
                                10 seconds<br>
                                Then I grinned and rode off with her<br>
                                Now she screaming in my ear like, "What, you forget we fucked for?"<br>
                                And then I laughed and rode off with her<br>
                                (That's some new shit)<br>
