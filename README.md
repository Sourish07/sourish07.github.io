# Sourish Kundu's Portfolio

## sourish.dev

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website!

Learn a bit about me, my projects, and my experiences at [www.sourish.dev](https://www.sourish.dev) or check out my blog at [www.sourish.dev/blog](https://www.sourish.dev/blog). Here, I write technical CS tutorials, about the tech industry as a whole, along with some broader topics regarding life, productivity, and happiness. I'm just getting started, but I look forward to writing more in the future.

Since this was my first foray into web development my freshman year of college, I've written the entire website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and a minimal amount of JS. Definitely not the most ideal approach, but I've learned a lot throughout my journey.

For my blog, I'm using jekyll, which allows for rapid static site generation.
