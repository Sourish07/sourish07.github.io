# Sourish Kundu's Portfolio

## sourish.dev

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website!

Learn a bit about me, my projects, and my experiences at [www.sourish.dev](https://www.sourish.dev) or check out my blog at [www.sourish.dev/blog](https://www.sourish.dev/blog). Here, I write technical CS tutorials, about the tech industry as a whole, along with some broader topics regarding life, productivity, and happiness. I'm just getting started, but I look forward to writing more in the future.

I used Next.js to statically generate this site with GitHub actions. That allows me to use React's modularity and ease of use while developing the site and still stays static for GitHub to serve.

Initally creating this site my freshman year of college was my first foray into web development, so I'd written the entire website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and a minimal amount of JS. Definitely not the most ideal approach, but I've learned a lot throughout my journey.

For the blog component of the site, I'm using Jekyll, which allows for rapid static site generation as well, without some of the features of Next.js.
