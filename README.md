# Sourish Kundu's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website!

Learn a bit about me, my projects, and my experiences at [sourish.dev](https://www.sourish.dev) or check out my blog at [sourish.dev/blog](https://www.sourish.dev/blog). Here, I write technical CS tutorials, about the tech industry as a whole, along with some broader topics regarding life, productivity, and happiness. I'm just getting started, but I look forward to writing more in the future.

I am currently using Vercel to host the site, which is created with Next.js. This grants me some unique advantages when it comes to performance optimizations, such as server side rendering/static generation, image optimizations, and client side transitions.

This site was my first foray into web development my freshman year of college, so I'd written the entire website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and a minimal amount of JS. Definitely not the most ideal approach, but since then, I've learned a lot throughout my journey.
